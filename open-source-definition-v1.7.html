	<p>Version 1.7</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	
	<font size="-1">
	
	<p><i>The indented, italicized sections below appear as annotations to the Open Source Definition (OSD) and are <b>not</b> a part of the OSD. A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found <a href="definition_plain.html">here</a>.</i></p>

	</font>
	
	</blockquote>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The
distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the
following criteria:

<a name="1"><h3>1. Free Redistribution</h3></a>

<p>The license may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the
software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing
programs from several different sources. The license may not require a
royalty or other fee for such sale.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we
eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order
to make a few short-term sales dollars.  If we didn't do this, there
would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect.</i>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="2"><h3>2. Source Code</h3></a>

<p>The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in
source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is
not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized
means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable
reproduction cost&#150;preferably, downloading via the Internet without
charge.  The source code must be the preferred form in which a
programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source
code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a
preprocessor or translator are not allowed.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve
programs without modifying them.  Since our purpose is to make
evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="3"><h3>3. Derived Works</h3></a>

<p>The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow
them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original
software.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent
peer review and rapid evolutionary selection.  For rapid evolution to
happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute
modifications.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="4"><h3>4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code</h3></a>

<p>The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified
form <em>only</em> if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with
the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.
The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from
modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a
different name or version number from the original software.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but users have a
right to know who is responsible for the software they are using.
Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they're
being asked to support and protect their reputations.</i></p>

<p><i>Accordingly, an open-source license <b>must</b> guarantee that
source be readily available, but <b>may</b> require that it be
distributed as pristine base sources plus patches.  In this way,
"unofficial" changes can be made available but readily distinguished
from the base source.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="5"><h3>5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</h3></a>

<p>The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum
diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to
contribute to open sources.  Therefore we forbid any open-source
license from locking anybody out of the process.</i></p>

<p><i>Some countries, including the United States, have export restrictions
for certain types of software.  An OSD-conformant license may warn
licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are
obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such
restrictions itself.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="6"><h3>6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</h3></a>

<p>The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in
a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program
from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps
that prevent open source from being used commercially.  We want
commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="7"><h3>7. Distribution of License</h3></a>

<p>The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program
is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license
by those parties.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means
such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="8"><h3>8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</h3></a>

<p>The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being
part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted
from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the
program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should
have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the
original software distribution.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="9"><h3>9. License Must Not Contaminate Other Software</h3></a>

<p>The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed
along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist
that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source
software.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> Distributors of open-source software have the
right to make their own choices about their own software.</i></p>

<p><i>Yes, the GPL is conformant with this requirement.  GPLed libraries
"contaminate" only software to which they will actively be linked
at runtime, not software with which they are merely distributed.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

	<h3>Conformance</h3>

<p>(This section is not part of the Open Source Definition.)</p>

<p>We think the Open Source Definition captures what the great majority
of the software community originally meant, and still mean, by the
term "Open Source".  However, the term has become widely used and
its meaning has lost some precision.  The <strong>OSI
Certified</strong> mark is OSI's way of certifying that the license
under which the software is distributed conforms to the OSD; the
generic term "Open Source" cannot provide that assurance, but we
still encourage use of the term "Open Source" to mean conformance to
the OSD.  For information about the <strong>OSI Certified</strong>
mark, and for a list of licenses that OSI has approved as conforming
to the OSD, see the OSD Certification Mark page.</p>

<h3>Change history</h3>

<p>
1.0 &#150; identical to DFSG, except for addition of MPL and QPL to clause 10.<br>
1.1 &#150; added LGPL to clause 10.<br>
1.2 &#150; added public-domain to clause 10.<br>
1.3 &#150; retitled clause 10 and split off the license list,
       adding material on procedures.<br>
1.4 &#150; Now explicit about source code requirement for PD software.<br>
1.5 &#150; allow "reasonable reproduction cost" to meet GPL terms.<br>
1.6 &#150; Edited section 10; this material has moved.<br>
1.7 &#150; Section 10 replaced with new "Conformance" section.

<h3>Origins</h3>

<p>

<p>Bruce Perens wrote the first draft of this document as "The Debian Free
Software Guidelines", and refined it using the comments of the Debian
developers in a month-long e-mail conference in June, 1997. He removed
the Debian-specific references from the document to create the "Open
Source Definition."</p>
